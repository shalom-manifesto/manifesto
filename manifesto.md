# The Shalom Manifesto
*A call to build towards peace & harmonay in partnership with the Creator and the creation.*

## Background: How We Got Here
eâ€™ve inherited a culture of exploitationâ€”  
a system that treats people like machines, communities like markets, and creation like raw material.  
A modern, industrial, human-centered mindset has shaped how we live, work, and build.

It prizes:  
- Scale over soul  
- Control over calling  
- Progress over presence  

And the result?

> A burned-out world.  
> Disintegrated people.  
> Disembodied innovation.  
> Fragmented communities.  
> A groaning creation.  

Weâ€™re surrounded by systems that pull us away from the very things we were made for:  
**relationship, rest, and harmony.**

## ðŸ§­ The Compass: Shalom

But there is another way.

A way that doesnâ€™t begin with ourselves, but with God.  
A way that doesnâ€™t exploit, but restores.  
A way that leads not to domination, but to **Shalom**.

Shalom is not stillness aloneâ€”  
it is **wholeness in right relationship** with the Creator, with one another, and with the earth.  
It is peace in motion. Harmony lived. The atmosphere of the Kingdom.

> **Shalom is our compass.**  
> Itâ€™s how we discern. How we design. How we define success.



## Beliefs

- **The Creator desires peace, not chaos.**  
- **Listening comes before building.**  
- **Stewardship is not dominationâ€”itâ€™s care.**  
- **Collaboration is greater than competition.**  
- **Creation is not a resource to extractâ€”it is a partner to honor.**  
- **Rest is a rhythm to protect, even at the expense of scale.**  
- **Worth is inherent, not earned. Identity is given, not gamified.**
- **Formation precedes function.**
- **Innovation is a spiritual act.**
- **The way we build matters as much as what we build.**
- **Success is measured by peace, not just profit.**

These beliefs are more than principles.  
They are practices. Markers. Reminders of what it means to build in step with Shalom.


## Outcomes
We commit to building:

- **Technology that doesnâ€™t consume attentionâ€”but forms people toward harmony**
- **Systems that amplify collective good over individual gain**  
- **Platforms that cultivate connection, not comparison**
- **Tools that support rest instead of fueling burnout**
- **Products that scale peace without consuming the people or planet that sustain them**
- **Innovation that reflects the Creatorâ€™s heartâ€”not just our ambition**

Because the fruit matters.  
And we believe the most faithful work bears fruit that makes the world more whole.
